A Virtual Keyboard project evolved to a Falling Words Typing Game (future keyboard typing lessons).
- The index.html file is kept empty (all the necessary elements are generated with the usage of JS).
- Pressing a key on a physical keyboard highlights the key on the virtual keyboard.
- Keystrokes are animated. 
- Built without any libraries or frameworks.
- Uses ESLint (eslint-config-airbnb-base).
